# GPA and WAM Calculator
Finished learning a bit of Python so this project was a bit of challenge to put together everything i've learned 
to a practical sense such as calculating the Weighted Mark Average and Grade Point Average for a student
Note: To use this program you will need to change the directory for which the 'grades.txt' is located.
