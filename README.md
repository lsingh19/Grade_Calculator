# GPA and WAM Calculator
Finished learning a bit of Python over the winter break so this project was a bit of challenge to put together some of my knowledge of Python for a practical application such as calculating the Weighted Mark Average and Grade Point Average for a student. 

Note: To use this program you will need to change the directory for which the 'grades.txt' is located. 

# What I Learned
- Reading and writing files in Python
- Creating new file within Python  
- Opening and Closing files
- Extracting and allocating a value inside a string to an integer/float variable
- A better understanding of Python syntax
